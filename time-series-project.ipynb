    "1. Install yahoo finance library (yfinance)\n",
    "2. Retrieve stock price data\n",
    "3. Choose any ticker symbol and you can choose “Open” or “Close” price for this project<sup>[1](#myfootnote1)</sup> <sup>[2](#myfootnote2)</sup>\n",
    "4. Analyse time series<sup>[3](#myfootnote3)</sup>\n",
    "5. Check for seasonality\n",
    "6. Train time series model\n",
    "7. Find the best hyperparameter values of (P, D, Q) with the smallest RMSE for building an ARIMA model<sup>[4](#myfootnote4)</sup>\n",
    "8. Predict price for the next time period (Maybe two Timestamps)\n",
    "9. Save timestamp, prediction and actual price to a database\n",

    "❗ BONUS: Deploy your model to Streamlit.  \n",
    "a. The app should pull fresh data from the web through yfinance  \n",
    "b. The user should be able to define a forecasting window (how far ahead they want the forecast)  \n",

    "❗❗ Extra Super Hard BONUS!! Allow the user to choose the ticker symbol to look up and get predictions for.   \n",

    "<a name=\"myfootnote4\">4</a>: Please set the hyperparameter values of (P, D, Q) within these ranges also for the purpose of saving time: For “P”: 1 ≦ P ≦ 3 For “D”: 0 ≦ D ≦ 2 For “Q”: 0 ≦ Q ≦ 2\n"
